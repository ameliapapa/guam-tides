As part of a research internship under the supervision of A/Prof Scott Heron, this script shows my work with sensor data provided by NOAA to investigate low tide events in Guam. This link (https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/27292) will direct you to the published report from the project.

The challenge we were facing in the analysis was missing values in the long-term dataset of air pressure. In the missing_data.R script I manipulated the data to use linear regression estimates and fill in the gaps.
